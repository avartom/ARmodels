# ARmodels
New methods of autoregressive models to predict time series. First, we divide the window of time into n equal time periods then we order the time series values into a monotone set S. Afterwards, we apply autoregressive models to each of this time periods. 

There is also an analogue of ARMA version that computes the mean of the different autoregressive models (more on this later).
